Configuration
=============

All the Gauge specific internal configurations are stored in
``gauge.properties`` file present in your Gauge install location
(``GAUGE_ROOT``). These properties are key value pairs.

Global
------

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :name: gauge_properties

    # set to a url, which acts as plugin repository for Gauge.
    gauge_repository_url = https://downloads.getgauge.io/plugin

    # set to a url, which holds version information of Gauge.
    # This is used to determine if an update is available.
    gauge_update_url = https://downloads.getgauge.io/gauge

    # set to an url, which acts as template repository for Gauge.
    gauge_templates_url = https://downloads.getgauge.io/templates

    # sets the timeout in milliseconds for making a 
    # connection to the language runner.
    runner_connection_timeout = 30000

    # sets the timeout in milliseconds for making a connection
    # to plugins (except language runner plugins).
    plugin_connection_timeout = 10000

    # sets the timeout in milliseconds for a plugin to stop
    # after a kill message has been sent.
    plugin_kill_timeout = 10000

    # sets the timeout in milliseconds for requests from the
    # language runner.
    # If the size of the project is too big, Gauge may timeout before the
    # runner returns the response message. This value can be configured
    # accordingly.
    runner_request_timeout = 10000

    # sets the excluded dirs for gauge.
    # Gauge always looks for concepts in the whole project, folders starting
    # with dot(.) are excluded and a user can add folders to the excluded
    # folders list by passing a comma separeted paths of folder.Paths can be
    # relative to the path of directory or absolute.
    gauge_exclude_dirs = "src/test,bin"

Local (Project level)
---------------------

Certain properties can be configured in
``env/default/default.properties``, which overrides the default
properties and are scoped only to the current project. These are key
value pairs.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :name: default_properties

    # The path to the gauge reports directory. Should be either relative to
    # the project directory or an absolute path
    gauge_reports_dir = reports

    # Set as false if gauge reports should not be overwritten 
    # on each execution.
    # If set to true, a new time-stamped directory will be 
    # created on each execution.
    overwrite_reports = true

    # Set to false to disable screenshots on failure in reports.
    screenshot_on_failure = false

    # The path to the gauge logs directory. Should be either relative to the
    # project directory or an absolute path
    logs_directory = GaugeLogs

    # Specify the level at which cached objects should get removed while
    # execution.

    # Possible values for this property are 'suite', 'spec' or 'scenario'.
    # default: 'scenario'.
    gauge_clear_state_level = spec
    # The above clears the objects after the execution of each specification, so
    # that new objects are created for next execution.

    # Set to false to disable screenshots on failure in reports.
    screenshot_on_failure = true

.. _environments:

Environments
------------

Environment specific
`variables <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable>`__ can
be managed using property files. The `property
files <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties>`__ have set of key
value pairs which are set as environment variables during execution.

Gauge allows you to create groups of property files, by defining and environment. 

A project can have multiple environments, and depending on the argument `--env` specified, 
the corresponding environment is loaded at runtime. `default` is the default environment, 
which is loaded when no `--env` is specified.

The env directory structure for a ``java`` project:

.. code-block:: text

    ├── env
      └── default
         ├── default.properties
         └── java.properties

Custom properties can be added to an existing property files or in a
newly created one.

Creating new environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create an environment called ``ci``:

-  Create a directory called ``ci`` in ``env`` directory
-  Add property files (e.g. ``user.properties``)

.. code-block:: text

    ├── env
       ├── ci
          |── user.properties
       |── default
          ├── default.properties
          └── java.properties

Executing with environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The environment is specified using the ``env`` flag. For example if
``ci`` environment is used during execution

.. code-block:: console

    gauge --env ci specs


Precedence of Environments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Precedence to the env variable value is given in the below order. 1.
User shell / OS env variable values 2. Project environment passed in the
``--env`` flag 3. Project environment present in the ``env/default`` dir
(if present) 3. Gauge default env variable values, as below

+---------------------------+-----------+
|Property                   | Value     |
+===========================+===========+
| gauge_reports_dir         | reports   |
+---------------------------+-----------+
| overwrite_reports         | true      |
+---------------------------+-----------+
| screenshot_on_failure     | true      |
+---------------------------+-----------+
| logs_directory            | logs      |
+---------------------------+-----------+

Gauge loads the enviroment variables as below.

-  When Gauge starts, the environment passed by the user in the
   ``--env`` flag will be loaded. If this flag is not passed by the
   user, ``default`` environment will be loaded.
-  Gauge will then load the ``default`` environment. Only the values
   which are not yet set will be loaded. This step won't overwrite the
   variables which are set in step 1.
-  Finally, Gauge will load the environment variables which are not yet
   set, as per the table above.
-  These values can be overwritten by explicitly setting the respective
   OS environment variables.
-  If the environment mentioned in the ``--env`` flag is not found in
   the project, Gauge will end with a non-zero exit code.
-  Gauge project doesn't need to have a ``default`` env since Gauge will
   use the above values as default. User can still set the ``default``
   env to either overwrite or add new env variables, but doesn't want to
   pass the ``--env`` flag.

Examples
~~~~~~~~

-  User executes ``gauge specs``

   -  If ``<project_root>/env/default`` is **not** present, Gauge will
      set the default env variables with values mentioned in the table
      above.
   -  If ``<project_root>/env/default`` is present, Gauge will set the
      env variables mentioned in the ``default`` environment. It will
      then set any env variable (which is not already set) as per the
      table above.

-  User executes ``gauge --env=java_ci specs``

   -  If ``<project_root>/env/java_ci`` is **not** present, Gauge will
      end with a non-zero exit code.
   -  If ``<project_root>/env/java_ci`` is present, Gauge will set the
      env variables mentioned in the ``java_ci`` environment. It will
      then load other variables from the ``default`` environment which
      are not already set. Finally, it will the set the env vars with
      values mentioned in the table above (if they are not already set).

-  User executes ``gauge_reports_dir=newReportsDir gauge specs`` or user
   explicitly sets ``gauge_reports_dir=newReportsDir`` in shell and then
   runs ``gauge specs``

   -  Gauge will set all the default env variables from ``env/default``
      directory and then from the above table, except for the variable
      ``gauge_reports_dir``. This variable's value will still continue
      to be ``newReportsDir``.

-  User executes
   ``gauge_reports_dir=newReportsDir gauge --env=java_ci specs`` or user
   explicitly sets ``gauge_reports_dir=newReportsDir`` in shell and then
   runs ``gauge --env=java_ci specs``

   -  Gauge will set the env variables mentioned in the ``java_ci``
      environment. It will then load other variables from the
      ``default`` environment which are not already set. Finally, it
      will the set the env vars with values mentioned in the table above
      (if they are not already set). However variable
      ``gauge_reports_dir``, which is explicitly set in the shell will
      not be overwritten. This variable's value will still continue to
      be ``newReportsDir``.

.. _language_config:

Language Plugin
---------------

General
^^^^^^^

Configuration properties set here will be available to the test
execution as environment variables. Please see :ref:`Environments <environments>` 
for more details.

Properties are defined in the following format.

.. code-block:: text

   sample_key = sample_value

Java
^^^^

Java Specific configuration changes can be made in the
``env/default/java.properties`` file.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :name: java_properties

    # Specify an alternate Java home if you want to use a custom version.
    gauge_java_home = PATH_TO_JAVA_HOME

    # Use this property if you need to override the build path for the
    # project.
    # Note: IntelliJ out directory will be usually auto-detected.
    gauge_custom_build_path = PATH_TO_CUSTOM_BUILDPATH

    # Specify the directory where additional libraries are kept.
    #   You can specify multiple directory names separated with a comma `,`
    #   `libs` directory in the gauge project is added by default.
    gauge_additional_libs = libs/*, PATH_TO_NEW_LIBRARY

    # Specify the JVM arguments passed to java while launching.
    gauge_jvm_args = <JVM_ARGS>

.. note::
    CSharp and Ruby language runners do not hold any configuration beyond what is listed in :ref:`default properties <default_properties>`.


HTTP Proxy
----------

Gauge connects to internet for downloading plugins, templates, etc. If
you are behind a proxy, you will have to configure the proxy settings so
that Gauge connects to internet via the proxy server.

Without Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If authentication is not required, set the environment variable
``HTTP_PROXY`` to proxy server URL.

.. code-block:: text

    export HTTP_PROXY=http://10.0.2.2:5678

With Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If authentication is required, set the environment variable
``HTTP_PROXY`` to proxy server URL along with the credentials.

.. code-block:: text

    export HTTP_PROXY=http://username:password@10.0.2.2:5678



Build tools
-----------

You can use Gauge with any of the build tools that you like.

Here are the sample build files for 

1. :ref:`Maven <maven>` 
2. :ref:`Gradle <gradle>` 
3. :ref:`Ant <ant_task>`

.. _gradle:

Gradle
^^^^^^

Use the gauge-gradle-plugin to execute specifications in your `Gauge <http://getgauge.io>`__ 
java project and manage dependencies using `Gradle <https://gradle.org//>`__.

Using plugin in project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Apply plugin ***gauge*** and add classpath to your ***build.gradle***.
Here is a sample gradle file,

.. code:: groovy

    apply plugin: 'java'
    apply plugin: 'gauge'
    apply plugin: 'application'

    group = "my-gauge-tests"
    version = "1.0.0"

    description = "My Gauge Tests"

    buildscript {
        repositories {
            mavenCentral()
        }
        dependencies {
            classpath 'com.thoughtworks.gauge.gradle:gauge-gradle-plugin:+'
        }
    }

    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
    }

    // configure gauge task here (optional)
    gauge {
        specsDir = 'specs'
        inParallel = true
        nodes = 2
        env = 'dev'
        tags = 'tag1'
        additionalFlags = '--verbose'
    }

The plugin is also available at `Gradle Plugin Portal <https://plugins.gradle.org/>`__. Find more details

+----------------+--------+--------------+

See gauge's :ref:`cli_flags` for list of all flags that be used with **-PadditionalFlags** option.

Adding/configuring custom Gauge tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to define new custom Gauge tasks by extending
``GaugePlugin`` class. It can be used to create/configure tasks specific
for different environments. For example,

.. code:: groovy

    task gaugeDev(type: GaugeTask) {
        doFirst {
            gauge {
                specsDir = 'specs'
                inParallel = true
                nodes = 2
                env = 'dev'
                additionalFlags = '--verbose'
            }
        }
    }

    task gaugeTest(type: GaugeTask) {
        doFirst {
            gauge {
                specsDir = 'specs'
                inParallel = true
                nodes = 4
                env = 'test'
                additionalFlags = '--verbose'
            }
        }
    }

.. _ant_task:

Ant Task
^^^^^^^^

Gauge specs can be invoked via Ant by adding the below configuration in your ``build.xml``

.. code-block:: xml
    :caption: build.xml

    <target name="specs">
        <exec executable="gauge">
            <arg value="specs"/>
        </exec>
    </target>

Integration with CI
-------------------

Gauge can be easily integrated with any `Continuous Integration <https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html>`__ environment.

Since Gauge supports first class command line, invoking it from any
CI/CD tool is very straightforward.

Steps to Integrate Gauge with CI tool:

-  Install the Gauge and language plugin on CI machine
-  Add gauge commands as tasks in CI to run tests.

   For example, to run the specs use ``gauge specs``
-  If you want to run specific instance of gauge on CI, set
   ``GAUGE_ROOT`` as environment variable to the path of specific
   instance.
-  Gauge returns html-reports, console output as result of execution
   which can be configured to view on CI.

Go.cd
^^^^^

`Go.cd <https://www.gocd.io/>`__, is a continuous integration and deployment
tool.

-  `Download <http://getgauge.io/get-started/index.html>`__ and Install Gauge on the Go Agents
-  Install the required gauge :ref:`language plugin <plugins-installation>` on the Go agents.

Tips on Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Gauge is installed system wide by default and not user wide. However,
   plugins are installed per user. So plugins should be installed via
   user account with which the Go agent executes. Refer default install
   location of Gauge and its plugins
   `here <http://getgauge.io/documentation/user/current/troubleshooting/installation.html>`__.

-  Alternately, you can set `custom location for
   plugins <http://getgauge.io/documentation/user/current/troubleshooting/installation.html#custom-plugin-install-location>`__
   so that its accessible to Go agent running as a different user.

Create execution task
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Create a new task which will run ``gauge specs``.
-  If you want to run only a subset of specs, you can use :ref:`tagged_execution`. 
    Eg. ``gauge --tags "tag1 & tag2" specs``
-  Adding a flag ``-p`` runs them using :ref:`parallel_execution`.
-  Run against specific :ref:`environments` using the ``--env`` flag
-  See the :ref:`cli_flags` for list of all flags that can be used.

Reports
~~~~~~~

-  Gauge generates **html-reports** after execution which can be
   configured in Go by adding a new artifact in Artifacts tab.

-  You can also add a `custom tab <https://docs.gocd.io/current/configuration/managing_artifacts_and_reports.html#using-tabs>`__ to view your html reports generated.

Snap
^^^^

`Snap <https://snap-ci.com/>`__, is a continuous integration and cloud deployment tool.

Integrating Gauge with Snap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Login to Snap and choose ``Add repository`` option to setup a new
   pipeline by selecting the repository which is a Gauge project.

Install Gauge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Gauge can be installed either by using the portable installer or by
   using any package manager. If you want to use Gauge installer, you
   can use a script like
   `this <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getgauge/gauge-example-java/master/install_latest_gauge.sh>`__.

If your agent is Linux(RHEL, CentOS), you can install gauge via ``yum``
by adding following commands:

::

    $ echo -e "[gauge-stable]\nname=gauge-stable\nbaseurl=http://dl.bintray.com/gauge/gauge-rpm/gauge-stable\ngpgcheck=0\nenabled=1" | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/gauge-stable.repo
    $ sudo yum install gauge
    $ gauge_setup

More details on installation on all operating systems can be found
`here <http://getgauge.io/documentation/user/current/installations/operating_system/>`__.

-  Install Gauge language plugin as:

   ::

       gauge --install <language>

Create execution task
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Add a task which will run ``gauge specs``.
-  If you want to run only a subset of specs, you can use :ref:`tagged_execution`. 
    Eg. ``gauge --tags "tag1 & tag2" specs``
-  Adding a flag ``-p`` runs them using :ref:`parallel_execution`.
-  Run against specific :ref:`environments` using the ``--env`` flag.
-  See the :ref:`cli_flags` for list of all flags that can be used.

Reports
~~~~~~~

-  Gauge generates **html-report** after execution whose location can be
   set by environment variable ``gauge_reports_dir``. This defaults to
   ``reports`` directory in the Gauge project.

-  You can add Gauge execution reports as ``artifacts`` in Snap so that
   it can be downloaded after the stage run.

Travis CI
^^^^^^^^^

`Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org/>`__ is a hosted, distributed
continuous integration service used to build and test software projects
hosted at GitHub.

Integrating Gauge with Travis CI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Login to Travis CI and goto ``accounts`` menu.
-  Choose your project repository to be built and flick that switch on.
   |accounts|

Creating tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Create a ``.travis.yml`` file in your peoject root.
-  Add these lines in ``.travis.yml`` according to the platform on which
   you want to build.

-  Gauge generates ``html-report`` after execution whose location can be
   set by environment variable ``gauge_reports_dir``. This defaults to
   ``reports`` directory in the Gauge project.

-  You can upload Gauge execution reports to your choice of hosted web
   server. Read
   `more <https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/uploading-artifacts/>`__ for
   uploading artifacts. # TeamCity
   `TeamCity <https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/>`__ is a powerful and
   user-friendly Continuous Integration and Deployment server that works
   out of the box.

TeamCity
^^^^^^^^

-  `Download <http://getgauge.io/get-started/index.html>`__ and Install
   Gauge on the agents. Read more on installing Gauge
   `here <http://getgauge.io/documentation/user/current/installations/operating_system/>`__.
-  Install the required Gauge :ref:`language plugins <plugins-installation>` on
   the agents as: ``gauge --install <language>``

Tips on Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Gauge is installed system wide by default and not user wide. However,
   plugins are installed per user. So plugins should be installed via
   user account with which the TeamCity agent executes. Refer default
   install location of Gauge and its plugins
   `here <http://getgauge.io/documentation/user/current/troubleshooting/installation.html>`__.

-  Alternately, you can set `custom location for
   plugins <http://getgauge.io/documentation/user/current/troubleshooting/installation.html#custom-plugin-install-location>`__
   so that its accessible to TeamCity agent running as a different user.

Create execution task
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Create a new project in TeamCity pointing to Gauge project repository
   URL.
-  Add a build step which will run ``gauge specs``. 
    |New build step|

-  If you want to run only a subset of specs, you can use :ref:`tagged_execution`. 
    Eg. ``gauge --tags "tag1 & tag2" specs``
-  Adding a flag ``-p`` runs them using :ref:`parallel_execution`.
-  Run against specific :ref:`environments` using the ``--env`` flag.
-  See the :ref:`cli_flags` for list of all flags that can be used.

Reports
~~~~~~~
