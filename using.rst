Using Gauge
===========

Gauge is a first class command line tool. This means that you can
operate entirely from the command line. Or, if you prefer to use an IDE
then Gauge also has excellent integration with multiple IDEs.

Command Line Interface
----------------------

Gauge has **first-class command line support**. With gauge `installed <../installations/README.md>`__, list 
the flags supported by running.

.. code-block:: console

   gauge

The command-line interface works across platforms. On GNU/Linux and OSX,
you can use any terminal. On Windows, you can use ``cmd`` or Powershell.

Creating a project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create or initialize a Gauge project use run 

.. code-block:: console

   gauge --init

For details, see how to `create a Gauge project <../getting_started/creating_a_gauge_project.md>`__.

Example
~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: console
   :caption: C#

   gauge --init csharp 
 
.. code-block:: console
   :caption: Java

   gauge --init java 

  
.. code-block:: console
   :caption: Ruby

   gauge --init ruby 

Executing tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Inside a Gauge project, you can execute your tests by invoking ``gauge``
with path to
`specifications <../gauge_terminologies/specifications.md>`__. By
convention, specifications are stored in the the ``./specs/``
sub-directory in the project root. 

The syntax is:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge [options] <path-to-specs>

The ``gauge`` command-line utility allows multiple ways to specify the
specifications to be executed. A valid path for executing tests can be
path to directories that contain specifications or path to specification
files or path to scenarios or a mix of any of these three methods.

Specify directories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can specify a single directory in which specifications are stored.
Gauge scans the directory and picks up valid specification files.

For example:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge specs/

You can also specify multiple directories in which specifications are
stored. Gauge scans all the directories for valid specification files
and executes them in one run.

For example:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge specs-dir1/ specs-dir2/ specs-dir3/

Specify specification files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can specify path to a specification files. In that case, Gauge
executes only the specification files provided.

For example, to execute a single specification file:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge specs/spec1.spec

Or, to execute multiple specification files:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge specs/spec1.spec specs/spec2.spec specs/spec3.spec

Specify scenarios
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also specify a specific
`scenario <../gauge_terminologies/scenarios.md>`__ or a list of
scenarios to execute. To execute scenarios, ``gauge`` takes path to a
specification file, followed by a colon and a zero-indexed number of
scenarios.

For example, to execute the second scenario of a specification file
named ``spec1.spec``, you would do:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge specs/spec1.spec:1

To specify multiple scenarios, add multiple such arguments. For example,
to execute the first and third scenarios of a specification file named
``spec1.spec``, you would do:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge specs/spec1.spec:0 specs/spec1.spec:2

Verbose reporting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, ``gauge`` reports at the specification level when executing
tests. You can enable verbose, step-level reporting by using the
``--verbose`` flag. For example:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge --verbose specs/


IDE Support

Step Quick Fix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have an unimplemented step in the spec file, it will be annotated
saying 'undefined step'. ``alt+enter`` can be pressed to open the quick
fix pop up. The destination of the implementation can be chosen, either
a new class or from a list of existing classes. It will then generate
the step with required annotation and parameters.

.. figure:: images/intellij-screenshots/quick_fix/fix.gif
   :alt: step quick fix

   step quick fix

Formatting
~~~~~~~~~~

A spec file can be formatted by pressing ``ctrl+alt+shift l`` (in
windows and linux) and ``cmd+alt+shift l``\ (in mac).

This formats all the elements of current spec including indentation of
tables and steps.

Execution
~~~~~~~~~

-  Specs can be executed by ``right click -> Run spec``.
-  Execute all specs inside a directory by
   ``right click -> Run specifications``

Single Scenario Execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A single scenario can be executed by doing a right click on the scenario
which should be executed and choosing the scenario.
``right click -> run -> Scenario Name``

*Note:* If the right click is done in context other than that of
scenario, by default, first scenario will be executed.

.. figure:: images/intellij-screenshots/execution/scenario.gif
   :alt: scenario execution

   scenario execution

Parallel Execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run multiple specifications in parallel

-  Right click on the ``specs`` directory and select
   ``Create Specifications`` option.
-  In the new Run configuration select ``In Parallel`` options. This
   will distribute specs execution based on number of cores the machine
   has.
-  You can also specify the ``Number of parallel execution streams``.
   This is optional

   ::

       Caution: Select parallel nodes based on current systems performance.
       For example on a 2 core machine select upto 4 parallel streams.
       A very large number may affect performance.

-  Select ``ok``. Now you can run this new configuration for parallel
   execution of specs.

Debugging
~~~~~~~~~

Debugging can be performed the same way spec execution works.

-  Right click on a specification or specs directory -> Debug. Execution
   will halt on marked
   `breakpoints <https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/help/breakpoints.html>`__.

Run Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can edit the run configuration to make changes to: \* The scenario
or spec file to be executed \* The environment to run against \* Add a
tag filter to the execution \* Choose the number of parallel streams

   -  Click OK.

-  The selected steps will be replaced with the specified concept name.
   |extract concept| # Additional Usability features

The intellij idea gauge plugin comes with more features to simplify
writing specifications.

Create Spec and Concept files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  You can right-click in under any directory in the specs directory and
   create a new
   `specification <../gauge_terminologies/specifications.md>`__ or
   `concept <../gauge_terminologies/concepts.md>`__ file. They will be
   created with a template to get you started.

Creating markdown table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  To easily create markdown tables in specification(.spec) or
   concept(.cpt) files you can use predefined table templates specifying
   the number of columns needed.

For example, to create a table with 4 columns type

.. figure:: images/intellij-screenshots/additional/table_type.png
   :alt: table template fill

   table template enter

Then fill the column names in the template.

Writing Specification Heading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  To write the specification heading in markdown, you can use the
   predefined heading template.

.. figure:: images/intellij-screenshots/additional/spec_heading.png
   :alt: spec heading enter

   spec heading enter

Then fill the specification name in the template.

.. figure:: images/intellij-screenshots/additional/spec_heading_fill.png

Format Specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  A specification file can be formatted easily using the keyboard
   shortcut ``ctrl+alt+shift+l`` (in windows and linux) and
   ``cmd+alt+shift+l``\ (in Mac).

This formats the specification including indentation of tables and
steps.

HTML Preview Tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  A specification file, written in markdown can be viewed as an HTML
   preview.

This is a spec file in markdown.

.. figure:: images/intellij-screenshots/html_preview/spec_text.png
   :alt: spec text

   spec text

On click of the ``HTML Preview`` tab at the bottom of the editor, it
shows the HTML equivalent preview of spec file.
